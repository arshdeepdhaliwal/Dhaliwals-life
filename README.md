Creating a portfolio showcasing my web development projects was a strategic decision driven by a desire to exhibit my skills, accomplishments, and growth in the field. This curated collection serves as a tangible testament to the practical application of my knowledge and expertise. By featuring diverse projects, ranging from dynamic websites to interactive web applications, I aim to convey my proficiency in various programming languages, frameworks, and design principles. The portfolio acts as a visual narrative of my journey in web development, allowing prospective clients, employers, or collaborators to grasp the depth and breadth of my capabilities. It serves as a virtual resume, offering a comprehensive overview of my technical prowess and problem-solving abilities. Moreover, the portfolio facilitates effective communication of my coding style, creativity, and commitment to delivering user-centric solutions. In a rapidly evolving tech landscape, a well-crafted portfolio not only establishes credibility but also demonstrates adaptability. It reflects my commitment to staying abreast of industry trends and incorporating cutting-edge technologies into my projects. Ultimately, this portfolio is not just a showcase but a dynamic tool that opens doors to exciting opportunities in the ever-expanding realm of web development.


# Process
Throughout this project, I created the framework in html.

Then I added the overall sections and areas of the page.

Then I needed to add style through css.

I proceeded to change the background color and added my image. 

I also added my work links on the html.

I styled and kept a rustic/simple design that seems easy on the eyes. 

I finished off with adding the contact me links which take you to Gmail and Github. 


# FYI
FYI: since we only have one project there is a placeholder. I will go back and add more to the portfolio as time goes on as this is a website that I will use when looking for a job. I also aim to add more designs and tricks as I learn more in the bootcamp.
